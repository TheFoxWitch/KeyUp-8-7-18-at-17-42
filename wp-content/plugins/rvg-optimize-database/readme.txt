== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I change the settings of this plugin? =
* Change the settings in the WP Admin Panel &raquo; Settings &raquo; Optimize Database -or- via the WP Admin Panel &raquo; Optimize Database icon (depends on settings)

= How do I run this plugin? =
* WP Admin Panel &raquo; Optimize Database. Then click the 'Start Optimization'-button -or- via the WP Admin Panel &raquo; Optimize Database icon (depends on settings)
* Click the 'Optimize DB (1 click)' link in the Admin Bar (if enabled)

= Why do I see 'InnoDB table: skipped...'? =
* That's because optimizing InnoDB tables is not really efficient, so change the table type to MyISAM to have them being optimized.
* Update: if you want to optimize your InnoDB tables too, just check the 'Optimize InnoDB tables too' option on the settings page

= After I ran the plugin, I got "Total savings since the first run: -64 KB" =
* Sometimes that happens when you optimize InnoDB tables (instead of MyISAM tables).
Optimizing InnoDB tables works differently than MyISAM.
InnoDB focuses on speed optimization and sometimes it means the database can grow a little.

= I scheduled the optimization for 8pm but it runs at 6pm (my local time) =
* The scheduler uses the local time of the web server which can differ from your own local time

= The plugin is visible in Main Site Tools but not in my subsites =
* Multisite Support
– Install the plugin as Network Administrator (Network Admin » Plugins)
– ‘Network Activate’ the plugin
– You only can configure and run the plugin on the main network site, but it will optimize ALL the sub-sites too!
